          Hello, my name is Rita Ogbuji. I'm from Imo State in Nigeria. I'm a
          creative writer and a media assistant working in a private firm.
          Currently, I'm studying Software Programming at BYU-Idaho. I'm from
          the Igbo tribe of Nigeria and I'm a Christian. I love playing
          volleyball and travelling. Most times I meditate in my room studying
          the Bible and praying; it refreshes my soul, gives me inspiration,
          direction, and wisdom in managing the affairs of my purpose and
          existence. I had my first degree in Food Science and Technology (BSc)
          from the Federal University of Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria. I'm a
          transcriptionist and am good at it with excellent skills in research.
          Over the years, I have learnt skills like catering, cake decoration,
          food production/processing, and sewing. I was raised by my mum and dad
          in a family of eight children, with four boys and four girls. My
          siblings are my friends and played a critical role in moulding my
          character as a teenager. I love them so much. I'm a hardworking,
          principled, humble, and cheerful person with positive vibes. Welcome
          to my Homepage, Cheers!
